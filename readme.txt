IndieWebified Press This bookmarklets.

== Description ==

This plugin is based on the idea and code of [@snarfed](https://snarfed.org/indieweb-press-this-bookmarklets-for-wordpress):

One big [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) _raison d’être_ is using your own web site to [reply](https://indieweb.org/reply),
[like](https://indieweb.org/like), [repost](https://indieweb.org/repost), and [RSVP](https://indieweb.org/rsvp) to posts and events. You do this by annotating links on your site with simple [microformats2](http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2) HTML.

Having said that, most people don’t want to write HTML to like or reply to something. WordPress’s [Press This bookmarklets](http://codex.wordpress.org/Press_This) can already start a new post with a link to the page you’re currently viewing. This code adds IndieWeb microformats2 markup to that link. Combined the [wordpress-webmention](https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-webmention) plugin, you can use this to respond to the current page with just two clicks.

What’s more, if you’re currently on a Facebook post or Twitter tweet, this adds the [Bridgy Publish](https://www.brid.gy/about#publish) link that will reply, like, favorite, retweet, or even RSVP _inside_ those social networks.
